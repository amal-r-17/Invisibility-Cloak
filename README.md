# Invisibility-Cloak
I present to you a simple python script that uses OpenCV to convert any ordinary blanket into the infamous Harry Potter's Invisibility cloak.

I am providing 2 python scripts
* Caputure_Background.py - snaps an image of the background and saves it.
* Invisibility_Cloak.py - This is the main program that makes the effect happen.

### Readme is yet to be finished.
